                With a degree in <span className='font-medium'>Information Technology</span>,
                I've transformed my passion for programming into a lifelong pursuit.
                My coding journey began during the era of {"  "}
                <span className='font-medium'>Xanga</span> and {"  "}
                <span className='font-medium'>Myspace</span>,
                and since then, I've marveled at the creative power of coding to
                craft visually appealing websites. From the early days of experimenting
                with Bootstrap to diving into the intricacies of {"  "}
                <span className='font-medium'>React</span>, {"  "}
                <span className='font-medium'>Node.js</span>, {"  "}
                and <span className='font-medium'>CSS</span>, {"  "}
                I've honed my skills in bringing ideas to life through technology.
                <br /><br />
                Constantly embracing innovation, I thrive on learning new technologies
                and techniques to elevate creative platforms. Now, on the lookout for a {"  "}
                <span className='font-medium'>full-time position</span> {"  "}in the dynamic world of tech,
                I bring a blend of experience and a hunger for continuous growth.

            <p>
                <span className='italic'>Beyond the screen</span>,
                I find joy in playing mobile games, immersing myself
                in fiction, and exploring the latest trends online. Committed to
                broadening my skill set, I'm currently delving into the realm of Animation
                and expanding my linguistic horizons through Duolingo. Coding isn't just
                a career for meâ€”it's a lifestyle that fuels my curiosity and commitment
                to staying at the forefront of technological evolution.
